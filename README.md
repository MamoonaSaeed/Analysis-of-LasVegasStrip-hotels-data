## Introduction
Tourism is a cornerstone of economic growth, generating substantial revenue, creating employment opportunities, and fostering development. It directly contributes to GDP, foreign exchange earnings, and tax revenue. Tourism also stimulates infrastructure development, entrepreneurship, and the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises. As the world continues to globalize, tourism is poised to play an even more prominent role in shaping the economic landscape of the future.

## Problem Statement
The objective is to extract valuable insights from the dataset through data analysis techniques. Additionally, the aim is to construct a data-driven model for predicting hotel ratings (scores) based on information related to hotel services and tourist reviews. This initiative is intended to assist both the tourism department and hotels in making informed decisions grounded in data.

## Data Source and Variables
The data is extracted from UCI repository and can be accessed from (here)

## Conclusion
The model's performance shows a notable improvement, with the accuracy increasing from 0.42 to 0.64. The F1 scores, particularly for classes 1 and 2, exhibit significant enhancement, addressing the previous challenges of misclassification. The potential for further model improvement is evident, and it could be more pronounced with an increased volume of data. The existing dataset, derived from the TripAdvisor website, comprises 504 observations, suggesting that a more robust model could be developed with a larger dataset. Additionally, incorporating more relevant features, such as cleanliness, view, and entertainment, has the potential to contribute to the model's efficacy.

## Recommendations
Hotels can create a more cozy and friendly vibe by not having too many rooms. People often like places that aren't too crowded.

Since most reviews come from couples and friends, hotels could make their entertainment options more appealing to these groups. This would help in keeping these customers happy and coming back.

It's a good idea for hotels to focus on providing facilities for business events. This could attract more business people who need places for meetings and seminars.

Since a lot of customers come from North America, hotels in Las Vegas might want to consider promotions to attract visitors from other parts of the world too.

To make guests happier, hotels could add more amenities. For example, adding sports facilities or entertainment options like movie halls, theaters, and art galleries can make a stay more enjoyable.
